📌 Project Overview:

This repository is part of my internship project at Developers Hub under the domain of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI & ML). The goal of this task is to perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of the widely used Iris dataset.

The project focuses on using core data science tools such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to build strong foundational skills in understanding and interpreting structured datasets.

🎯 Objective:

Load and inspect the Iris dataset.

Understand data structure and distributions through summary statistics.

Create visualizations to identify relationships and patterns in the data.

Detect potential outliers using graphical methods.

📁 Dataset Description:
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers across three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample has four features.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:
Python

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE


🚀 Tasks Completed:
✅ 1. Data Loading
Loaded the dataset using seaborn.load_dataset("iris")

Displayed dataset shape, column names, and first few rows

✅ 2. Data Inspection
Used .info() to understand data types and null values

Used .describe() for basic statistical analysis

✅ 3. Data Visualization
Scatter Plot: To observe relationships between features like Sepal Length vs Sepal Width

Histograms: To examine distributions of numerical features

Box Plots: To detect outliers and understand value ranges


Sample Visualizations
Plot Type--	                    Purpose
Scatter Plot--                 Relationship between features (colored by species)
Histogram--	                   Distribution of each feature
Box Plot--	                   Outlier detection and spread analysis
Correlation--                  Heatmap To find feature correlation strength

🧠 Skills Practiced:
📂 Loading and inspecting data with pandas

📊 Creating meaningful plots using seaborn and matplotlib

📈 Drawing insights from visualized patterns

💡 Understanding feature distributions and variability

📚 Learning Outcome:
This task helped reinforce fundamental data exploration skills that are essential for any machine learning pipeline. It enhanced my understanding of:

Working with tabular datasets

Plotting and interpreting relationships

Building visual storytelling skills in the context of AI & ML

🧾 Future Scope:
Extend to building a classification model (e.g., using Logistic Regression or KNN)

Use pairplot, violin plots, or PCA for dimensionality reduction

Convert the analysis into a dashboard using Streamlit or Plotly Dash
