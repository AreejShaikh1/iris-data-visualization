# 🌸 Iris Dataset: Data Exploration and Visualization

This project is part of my internship at **Developers Hub**, where I am working in the **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** domain. The objective of this task is to understand and visualize a simple dataset using fundamental data exploration and plotting techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To explore the **Iris Dataset** by inspecting its structure, generating descriptive statistics, and visualizing key patterns and relationships using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Name**: Iris Flower Dataset  
- **Source**: Available via `seaborn` or from UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Features**:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
  - Species (Target class)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- pandas (data handling)  
- matplotlib (basic plotting)  
- seaborn (advanced statistical plotting)

---

## 🚀 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Loading**  
   - Loaded the dataset using `seaborn.load_dataset()` and `pandas.read_csv()` methods.

2. **Initial Inspection**  
   - Displayed dataset shape, column names, and first few records using `.shape` and `.head()`.

3. **Data Summary**  
   - Used `.info()` to understand data types and null values.  
   - Applied `.describe()` to generate summary statistics for numeric features.

4. **Visualization Techniques**
   - **Scatter Plot**: To explore relationships between different flower features.
   - **Histograms**: To understand the distribution of each numerical feature.
   - **Box Plots**: To detect outliers and observe statistical ranges.
